#About 

The Movie Watchlist is a dynamic web application built using React and leveraging the power of an API to create a seamless movie tracking experience. With this application, users can easily keep track of the movies they've watched and discover new ones to add to their list. The React framework allows for a smooth and interactive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

Using a carefully chosen API, the Movie Watchlist fetches movie data such as titles, genres, release dates, and ratings. This data is then presented to users, making it convenient to search, sort, and filter through their movie collection. Additionally, users can mark movies as watched, add new films to their watchlist, and remove those they've already seen.

The project aims to provide movie enthusiasts with a visually appealing and intuitive platform for organizing their cinematic experiences. By integrating an API, users can access up-to-date information on the latest releases, ensuring their movie watchlist is always current and relevant. Whether it's creating a personalized movie library or discovering new cinematic gems, the Movie Watchlist offers a seamless, efficient, and enjoyable way to manage one's movie preferences.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
